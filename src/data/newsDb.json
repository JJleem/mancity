      "TitleOne": "Pep Guardiola says wholesale changes to his Manchester City squad are unlikely during the current transfer window.",
      "DescOne": "City have made one signing so far this summer, with 20-year-old winger Savinho joining the club on a five-year deal.\n\nGuardiola admits there’s always a chance there could be incomings but says he is comfortable with his options and feels he has a good blend of talent and personality in his squad, which he feels is difficult to replace.\n\n“If someone leaves, we are going to talk about that and, of course, until the last day [of the transfer window] we have chances,” he said in a press conference ahead of our first pre-season Tour match against Celtic at the Keenan Memorial Stadium in Chapel Hill, North Carolina on Tuesday.\n\n “I don’t rule out new players as an option, but I think there is an 85, 90, 95% chance we will have the same squad.”\n\nMeanwhile the boss says Kevin De Bruyne will remain at City this season amid reports of an exit.\n\n“Kevin isn’t leaving,” Guardiola said.",

      "DescOne": "A first half brace from Nicolas Kuhn and smart Kyogo Furuhashi finish meant City went in behind at the break despite Oscar Bobb also finding the net.\n\nWith Celtic’s Scottish Premier League season getting under way in just over one week, their extra sharpness initially told in the Kenan Memorial Stadium’s North Carolina heat.\n\nA defiant second half display, spearheaded by the irrepressible Bobb, pulled City level though with Maximo Perrone and Erling Haaland both on target, but the Scottish champions found a winner through substitute Luis Palma.\n\nIt was harsh on City, but the sight of academy products Jahmai Simpson-Pusey, Jadel Katongo, Joel Ndala and Nico O’Reilly all making their senior debuts provided a major positive in our pre-season opener.\n\n Enjoy the best of the action by playing the video above...",
